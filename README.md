## [VIDEO GAME SALES ANALYSIS](https://github.com/nidhigupta13/DATA-ANALYTICS-PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Video%20Games%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis)
 The analysis shows the total sales for each developer and publisher and 
  also describes the maximum and minimum sales for a selected year, month and platform with   the recommendation of the title and series of video games. 
      
   * The dataset is from Kaggle.
   * At first, the data was cleaned using MySQL 
        Removed all the blank fields and renamed them with more meaningful and abstract names.
   * [MySQL File](https://github.com/nidhigupta13/DATA-ANALYTICS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Video%20Games%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis/Clean%20data%20(bets%20selling%20video%20games).sql) 
   * Export the CSV file from MySQL and import it into Power BI for further analysis and visualization work.
   * Under Power query editor in Power BI, extract month and year from the date column. 
   * Concluded the visualization work by adding the slicer for the year, month and platform, 
         displaying the total, maximum and minimum sales for each selected field with the title and series of the video games.
